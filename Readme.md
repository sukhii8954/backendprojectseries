<!-- CORS -->
# Allow us to do settings for  cross origin resource sharing - It is a security feature implemented by web browsers that controls how web pages in one domain can request resources from another domain. Itâ€™s like a safety gate that prevents potentially harmful cross-origin requests unless explicitly allowed.

<!-- Cookie parser -->
# The cookie-parser npm package is a middleware used in Node.js, specifically with the Express.js framework. Its main function is to parse the cookies attached to the client request object (req.cookies), making it easier to read and work with cookies in server-side applications.

<!-- infor about middlewars and req and res -->

# when someone hit any url then server get request to send response but before that there is something which first check user is authorized to get such response back or not

# example : on hitting url /instagram user first asked : logged in or not ? before receiving data from server 
# that in between check if user is logged in : is middleware

# we can put another middleware or multiple middlewares : like check if user is admin ?
# we can control moving of user from one checking to another check by use "next" (it is like a flag to check)

# ex: (err , req , res , next)   next -> we talking about middleware


# making a wrapper which is generally used so that whenever we need
# to use such wrapper we will pass function in that wrapper and then it will execute our function and return it : making asynHandler in utils

# using cloudinary to upload file  and will learn how to use Multer package in backend for file upload instead of express fileupload
