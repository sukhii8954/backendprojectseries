# HTTP headers 
->we can find headers in req and as well as in response 
->different req comes get different req headers 

at the end -> headers are the metadata...

metadata -> key-value sent along with req and response
ex: name : sukh
     key - value

* Req headers -> from client
* Resp headers -> from server
* Representation Headers -> encoding /compression
* payload headers -> data  ( ex- _id , email of user e have to send we ref data as payload)

-> caching , authentication , manage state  

# ** Most common headers **

·Content - Type (images , pdf etc)
· Cookie  (like an object: consist of time till we keep signed in user , unique code etc)
. Cache - Control (when to make data expire ex:- making it expire after 3600sec )


 # ** CORS **
     Access - Control - Allow - Origin  (allowing different origins from where request can come )
     Access - Control - Allow - Credentials  (controlling which credentials are allowed)
     Access - Control - Allow - method (example :- allowing GET method only not POST method )


# ** Security **

Cross-Origin - Embedder - Policy
Cross - Origin-Openes - Policy
